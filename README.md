# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Data

- Data preprocessing to clean the dataset.
- Feature engineering to create time-series features (e.g., lag values, rolling means).
- Machine learning model training using XGBoost to forecast future sales.
- Evaluation of the model with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It contains retail transaction data from a UK-based online store.
